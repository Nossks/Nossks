## 🔥 Projects

### 1️⃣ Legal Assistant
- It's a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to answer questions about a custom corpus of legal documents by finding the most relevant text snippets.
- The system is built on Python, using Flask for the web server, LangChain and Hugging Face transformers for the AI logic, and ChromaDB as the vector database for efficient document retrieval. 

### 2️⃣ Resume Matcher
- End-to-end ML Flask app that extracts, processes, and recommends jobs from resumes.  
- Uses PyMuPDF, Gensim, scikit-learn with local deployment.  

### 3️⃣ Celebrity Look-Alike
- Detects and crops faces, generates embeddings, and finds closest celebrity.  
- Uses MediaPipe + ResNet50 + MLP with cosine similarity for fast retrieval.  

### 4️⃣ Sign Language Detection
- Real-time ASL → text web app using webcam input.  
- CPU-friendly Random Forest model with prediction-stability buffer and Flask backend.
