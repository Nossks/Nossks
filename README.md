## 🔥 Projects

### 1️⃣ FinGuard | Privacy-First Fraud RAG
- The Build: Developed a RAG pipeline using CyborgDB and LangChain to encrypt vector embeddings, ensuring data privacy in forensic retrieval.
- Key Innovation: Engineered an intelligent router to toggle between low-latency chat and deep retrieval; benchmarked at 13 QPS with a minimal 4.2% privacy overhead.
- Tech: Python, CyborgDB, LangChain, Flask, Vector Encryption.

### 2️⃣ EviScore | Multilingual Clinical Extraction
- The Build: Architected a pipeline to extract structured data from multilingual (Hinglish) medical journals using Sentence-Transformers.
- Key Innovation: Eliminated hallucinations by engineering Pydantic guardrails and a Semantic N-gram Scorer (mBERT) to ensure cross-lingual term grounding.
- Tech: Python, Sentence-Transformer, Pydantic, LangChain, Multilingual-BERT. 

### 3️⃣ Celeb Look-Alike | Metric Learning & CV
- The Build: Fine-tuned ResNet50 and implemented MediaPipe for face alignment, standardizing inputs against pose and lighting variations.
- Key Innovation: Boosted accuracy from 45% to 83.4% through layer unfreezing and data augmentation; utilized L2-Normalized Embeddings for precise one-shot matching.
- Tech: Python, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, Scikit-Learn, Flask.
